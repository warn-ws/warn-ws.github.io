Antonio is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (IIIA) working in the Value-Aware Artificial Intelligence(VALWAI) project that aims at developing AI systems that are able to understand and act by a value system and explain their own behaviour or understand the behaviour of others in terms of a value system. He was a Research Scientist at Pal Robotics awarded with a Marie Skłodowska-Curie cofund fellowship in the H2020 project PRO-CARED (no.801342) which aimed at designing social robots with proactive personalised behaviour during long-lasting interactions (2022-2024). He received his PhD with a thesis entitled “Personalising robot assistance for cognitive training therapy” from the Institut de Robòtica i Informàtica Industrial (IRII) under the supervision of Dr. Guillem Alenyà and Prof. Carme Torras (2017-2022). He was an Early Stage Researcher in the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network (ITN) project called SOCRATES, which focused on Quality of Interaction in Eldercare.
His main research interests are in the areas of human-robot interaction (HRI) and human-centered design technologies. His work focuses on designing, developing, and evaluating interactive social systems that can be personalised and that can adapt to their users over short-term and long-term interactions, based on individual’s unique needs and goals.
